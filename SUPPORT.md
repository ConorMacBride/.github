# Getting Help

## Documentation

The SunPy [documentation][] should be your first stop to get your
question answered. We strive to provide a rich and comprehensive set of
docs. The documentation is included in the code itself which you can
access through [code reference][] and we also have a number of
[guides][] which take you through specific topics. If you do not find
your answer there read on!

## Community

You can stay up to date on the development of SunPy and interact with
the community with these helpful resources. Anyone can and is encouraged
to get involved. Many methods of interactions are available and listed
here:

- Read and subscribe to [The SunPy Blog][].
- Subscribe to the [SunPy Mailing List][].
- Join us on github and add a feature request or bug report to our [issue list][].
- Chat with fellow SunPy users or developers on our [matrix channel][].
- Join us at one of our weekly meetings. Check out [our calendar][] to find the next one.

We are looking forward to meeting you! Please be aware that we have a
[Code of Conduct][], that sets out how everyone should and will behave
with each other.

## Mailing List

Sometimes the best way to get your question answered is just by asking
someone. SunPy has two mailing lists; a [general mailing
list][SunPy Mailing List] for general issues and a [developer mailing
list][]. If you have a general question about how SunPy works use the
main list. The general mailing list is another way to get help with
doing solar physics in Python. If, on the other hand, you have a
question about the inner workings of SunPy or how SunPy is organized or
have a question about developing some new feature please use the
developer mailing list.

## Live Chat

We have a [matrix channel][] which will open directly in your browser.
You will find the many SunPy users and the developers within the
channel. Please stop by and say hello! You can login with any matrix
account by typing in your full username, i.e. `@cadair:matrix.org`.
