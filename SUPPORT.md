# Getting Help

## Documentation

We strive to provide a rich and comprehensive set of documentation for all packages under the sunpy project.
For sunpy, the [sunpy documentation] includes [examples] and an API layout that you can access through the [code reference].
All packages under the sunpy project, they will have their own hosted documentation you can browse.
Many should be found under the "Documentation" dropdown above.

## Community

You can stay up to date on the development of sunpy and interact with the community with these helpful resources:

- Read and subscribe to [the sunpy blog].
- Subscribe to the [sunpy mailing list].
- Join us on github and add a feature request or bug report to our [issue list].
- Chat with fellow sunpy users or developers on our [element.io channel].
- Join us at one of our weekly meetings. Check out [our calendar] to find the next one.

Anyone can and is encouraged to get involved and we look forward to meeting you!
Please be aware that we have a [Code of Conduct], that sets out how everyone should and will behave with each other.

## Mailing List

sunpy has two mailing lists; a [general mailing list] for general issues and a [developer mailing list].
If you have a general question about how sunpy works please use the general mailing list and it is another way to get help with doing solar physics with Python.
If, on the other hand you have a question about the inner workings of sunpy, how sunpy is organized or have a question about developing some new feature please use the developer mailing list.

## Live Chat

We have a [element.io channel] and you will find many sunpy users and developers within the channel.
Please stop by and say hello.
You can login with any element.io account by typing in your full username, i.e. `@cadair:matrix.org`.
